# QuickEx Privacy Contract

Soroban smart contract implementing X-Ray privacy features for QuickEx.

## Overview

This contract provides the foundational privacy and escrow capabilities for the QuickEx platform. It enables:

- **Privacy Controls**: Selective visibility of on-chain activities
- **Escrow Services**: Secure holding of assets during transactions
- **Audit Trails**: Maintainable history of privacy state changes

## Contract reference

- Entrypoint API reference: [doc/CONTRACT_ENTRYPOINT_REFERENCE.md](doc/CONTRACT_ENTRYPOINT_REFERENCE.md)
- Stealth derivation and fixed test vectors: [docs/STEALTH_ADDRESS_DERIVATION.md](docs/STEALTH_ADDRESS_DERIVATION.md)

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Soroban CLI (`cargo install soroban-cli`)
- wasm32-unknown-unknown target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)

## Building

```bash
# Navigate to the contract directory
cd app/contract

# Build the contract for release (optimized)
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Build with optimized settings
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile release-with-logs
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_enable_and_check_privacy

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests with coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
```

## Quality Checks

```bash
# Check code formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run all quality checks (fmt + clippy + test)
cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

## Deployment

### Local Network (for testing)

```bash
# Start local Soroban network
soroban dev

# Deploy contract to local network
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quickex.wasm \
  --source default

# Initialize contract (if needed)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source default \
  -- \
  health_check
```

### Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quickex.wasm \
  --source test \
  --network testnet

# Verify deployment
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source test \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  health_check
```

### Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to mainnet (use with caution!)
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/quickex.wasm \
  --source main \
  --network mainnet
```

## Contract Spec Export

Export the contract's method/argument spec, along with the current
contract and event schema versions, as a stable JSON artifact:

```bash
./scripts/export-contract-spec.sh
```

The artifact is written to `docs/contract-spec/contract-spec.json` and
includes `contract_version`, `event_schema_version`, and the full function
interface, so contributors and tooling can introspect available methods
without reading the Rust source. `scripts/test-contract-spec-export.sh`
verifies the export is stable across repeat builds and includes all
required fields.

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the contract code
2. Run quality checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
3. Run tests: `cargo test`
4. Build and test deployment locally: `soroban dev`
5. Create PR with changes

## Main Flows

### 1. Deployment & initialisation

1. Deploy the contract WASM.
2. Call `initialize(admin)` once to set the admin (required for pause, upgrade, admin transfer).

### 2. Deposit → Withdraw (escrow)

1. **Deposit**: Call `deposit(token, amount, owner, salt)` or `deposit_with_commitment(from, token, amount, commitment)`. The owner/from must authorize the token transfer.
2. Store the returned commitment (or the one you provided) securely; it is required to withdraw.
3. **Withdraw**: Call `withdraw(_token, amount, _commitment, to, salt)` with `to` as the recipient. The commitment is recomputed from `to`, `amount`, and `salt`; it must match an existing pending escrow. `to` must authorize.

### 3. Privacy

Privacy state is a single canonical boolean per account (Issue #862 / SC-W8-01), stored under `DataKey::PrivacyEnabled`. It is impossible for the two call styles below to disagree about the same account.

- **Canonical**: `set_privacy(owner, enabled)` and `get_privacy(owner)`.
- **Deprecated shim**: `enable_privacy(account, level)` (`level` must be `0` or `1`), `privacy_status(account)`, `privacy_history(account)`. These delegate to the same underlying state and error handling as `set_privacy`/`get_privacy` — prefer the canonical pair for new integrations. Accounts whose state was last written through this deprecated API before the consolidation are transparently migrated onto the canonical key the first time either API touches them.

### 4. Admin

- `set_paused(caller, new_state)` – pause/unpause (caller must be admin).
- `propose_admin_transfer(caller, new_admin, delay_secs)` – start a timelocked admin transfer (**Admin only**).
- `accept_admin_transfer(caller)` – complete a pending admin transfer once its delay has elapsed (must be called by the proposed admin).
- `cancel_admin_transfer(caller)` – cancel a pending admin transfer (**Admin only**).
- `get_pending_admin_transfer()` – view the currently pending admin transfer proposal, if any.
- `upgrade(caller, new_wasm_hash)` – upgrade contract (caller must authorize).
- `migrate(caller)` – run post-upgrade storage migration steps for the current release.
- `get_version()` – inspect the stored schema version (`0` means a legacy deployment with no version key yet).

### 5. Read-only queries

- `get_commitment_state(commitment)` – escrow status (Pending/Spent/Expired).
- `verify_proof_view(amount, salt, owner)` – verify withdrawal params without submitting a tx.
- `get_escrow_details(commitment)` – full escrow entry.

## Contract Interface

The contract exposes the following functions:

### Storage Layout

The contract uses persistent storage with the following structure:

- `DataKey::Escrow(Bytes)` - Maps commitment hash to `EscrowEntry` containing token address, amount, owner, status, and creation timestamp
- `DataKey::EscrowCounter` - Tracks the number of escrows created
- `DataKey::Admin` - Stores the admin address
- `DataKey::Paused` - Stores the paused state of the contract
- `DataKey::PrivacyEnabled(Address)` - Canonical boolean privacy state for each account (single source of truth)
- `DataKey::PrivacyLevel(Address)` - Deprecated numeric privacy level; read-only migration fallback
- `DataKey::PrivacyHistory(Address)` - Append-only audit history from the deprecated `enable_privacy` shim

The `EscrowEntry` struct contains:

- `token: Address` - The token address
- `amount: i128` - The escrowed amount
- `owner: Address` - The owner of the escrow
- `status: EscrowStatus` - The status (Pending, Spent, Expired)
- `created_at: u64` - The ledger timestamp when created

Helper functions:

- `put_escrow(env: &Env, commitment: &Bytes, entry: &EscrowEntry)` - Store an escrow entry
- `get_escrow(env: &Env, commitment: &Bytes)` - Retrieve an escrow entry
- `has_escrow(env: &Env, commitment: &Bytes)` - Check if an escrow entry exists

### Privacy Management

- `set_privacy(owner: Address, enabled: bool)` - Canonical entrypoint; enable/disable privacy for an account
- `get_privacy(owner: Address)` - Canonical entrypoint; get current privacy state for an account
- `enable_privacy(account: Address, privacy_level: u32)` - Deprecated shim (`privacy_level` must be `0` or `1`); delegates to `set_privacy`
- `privacy_status(account: Address)` - Deprecated shim; get canonical privacy state as `Option<u32>`
- `privacy_history(account: Address)` - Deprecated audit history of levels requested via `enable_privacy`

### Escrow

- `deposit(token: Address, amount: i128, owner: Address, salt: Bytes)` - Deposit funds and create an escrow entry
- `withdraw(to: Address, amount: i128, salt: Bytes)` - Withdraw funds by proving commitment ownership
- `create_escrow(from: Address, to: Address, amount: u64)` - Create escrow

### Amount Commitments (X-Ray Privacy Placeholder)

- `create_amount_commitment(owner: Address, amount: i128, salt: Bytes) -> Bytes` - Create a deterministic commitment hash
- `verify_amount_commitment(commitment: Bytes, owner: Address, amount: i128, salt: Bytes) -> bool` - Verify a commitment against claimed values

## Amount Commitments API

### Overview

The amount commitment functions provide a **placeholder** for X-Ray privacy shielded flows. These are deterministic SHA256-based commitments without real zero-knowledge guarantees. Future versions will integrate actual ZK proofs.

### Use Cases

- **Shielding transaction amounts** before full ZK integration
- **API shape validation** for frontend and backend clients
- **Audit trail commitments** to record hidden values without exposing them

### Serialization Format

Commitments are computed as `SHA256(owner_bytes || amount_bytes || salt_bytes)`:

| Component | Size        | Format                 | Description               |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Owner     | Variable    | XDR-serialized Address | Soroban address bytes     |
| Amount    | 16 bytes    | Big-endian i128        | Transaction amount value  |
| Salt      | 0-256 bytes | Raw bytes              | Randomness for uniqueness |

**Result**: 32-byte SHA256 hash

### API Examples

#### Create a Commitment

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{Address, Bytes, contract, contractimpl};

let owner = Address::from_string(&env, &"GXXXXX...");  // Owner's address
let amount = 1_500_000i128;                            // Amount in stroops
let salt = Bytes::from_slice(&env, &[42, 13, 99]);    // Random bytes

// Generate commitment
let commitment = client.create_amount_commitment(&owner, &amount, &salt);
// Result: 32-byte hash

// Store or transmit commitment (e.g., in transaction metadata)
```

#### Verify a Commitment

```rust
// Later, verify the commitment against claimed values
let is_valid = client.verify_amount_commitment(&commitment, &owner, &amount, &salt);

if is_valid {
    // Commitment matches; amount was not tampered with
    println!("Commitment verified!");
} else {
    // Mismatch: amount, salt, or owner was modified
    println!("Commitment invalid!");
}
```

#### Handling Tampering

```rust
// If any component is modified, verification fails
let wrong_amount = amount + 1;
assert!(!client.verify_amount_commitment(&commitment, &owner, &wrong_amount, &salt));

let modified_salt = Bytes::from_slice(&env, &[42, 13, 100]);
assert!(!client.verify_amount_commitment(&commitment, &owner, &amount, &modified_salt));

let other_owner = Address::generate(&env);
assert!(!client.verify_amount_commitment(&commitment, &other_owner, &amount, &salt));
```

### Constraints & Limitations

- **No confidentiality**: Commitments are deterministic hashes, not ZK proofs. Do not rely on them for privacy.
- **Maximum salt length**: 256 bytes to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Non-negative amounts**: Negative amounts will panic; validate client-side.
- **Deterministic only**: Same inputs always produce identical commits; useful for audits but no hiding.
- **Not production-grade privacy**: Mark this feature as "experimental" in UX; full privacy requires ZK integration.
